# Spreadsheet Tools

A collection of tools that started as some CSV processing utilities to help
with unit testing of stub data.

Presently this consists of a CSV helper library for parsing CSV content. This
can be useful in the context of unit tests where reliable stub-data may be
required without the need for hard-coding.
